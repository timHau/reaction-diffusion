# Reaction Diffusion

This System was build on top of [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/)
which is an awesome C++ Library to get started with graphics programming.

---
I used it to implement a [reaction-diffusion
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system) which
is a mathematical way to model some chemical reactions. Imagine you have two
Substances `A` and `B` which tend to react with one another if the concentration of
one Substance is above a certain treshold.

## Getting started
I only build it on my machine (macos, Xcode version 10.0) and did not spend too much time testing it on
other machines, as it was just a side project.
